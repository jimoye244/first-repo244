        <p>
            I started programming after my high school and got an Associate Degree in computer science thereafter. 
            During the time I was going through the associate degree programme there were very few computers as w
            ell as books to read. We rely heavily on whatever the instructor can give and it was really difficult. T
            he programming journey started with C language and the sight of buffer overflow almost took me out of the CS programme. 
            However, after a lot of perseverance, I scaled through.

            <h3>Likes</h3>
            I love learning new languages even though I might not be good at it but I always want to have an idea. 
            I love working with others and believe in team work. I enjoy being a servant leader and very 
            ready to treat others with diginity and respect.
